# CI/CD Examples

This website contains examples on how to develop CI/CD pipelines and how to configure development environment for working with CI/CD pipelines.

## Installing Docker

Many of the examples provided on this website require Docker and Docker Compose to be installed on your development environment.

See [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for official installation instructions. If you use Docker a lot on Mac or Windows system, the recommended Docker Desktop is likely a good option for you. Note that, since January 2022, it has required paid subscription, if used for commercial development.

Alternatively, Windows users can [install Docker on top of WSL2](./docker/docker-on-wsl/). For Mac users there are alternatives, such as [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima), available.
